We\textquotesingle{}ll go through the recommended set-\/up of {\ttfamily event-\/driven} for a first time user of the {\ttfamily Y\+A\+RP} environment. The first step is to create a directory in which to install {\ttfamily Y\+A\+RP}, {\ttfamily event-\/driven} and the eventual modules you will write. For example\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
mkdir ~/yarp-install
\end{DoxyCode}
 Secondly, we want to set up some environment variables that will make the install go smoother. Use your favourite text editor to open {\ttfamily $\sim$/.bashrc} and add the following lines\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
export INSTALL\_DIR=~/yarp-install
export CMAKE\_PREFIX\_PATH=$CMAKE\_PREFIX\_PATH:$INSTALL\_DIR
export YARP\_DATA\_DIRS=$INSTALL\_DIR/share/yarp:$INSTALL\_DIR/share/event-driven
export PATH=$PATH:$INSTALL\_DIR/bin
\end{DoxyCode}
 and don\textquotesingle{}t forget to {\ttfamily source $\sim$/.bashrc} to apply the changes!

Next we want to get the required repositories. Change directory into one in which you want these projects, for example\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
mkdir ~/projects && cd ~/projects
\end{DoxyCode}
 then, 
\begin{DoxyCode}
git clone https://github.com/robotology/YCM.git
git clone https://github.com/robotology/yarp.git
git clone https://github.com/robotology/event-driven.git
\end{DoxyCode}
 \+:warning\+: We are going to build the repositories in the above order too! However, first you might need some extra dependencies for {\ttfamily Y\+A\+RP}. One option is to go \href{http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Linux:Installation_from_sources}{\tt here} and follow the {\itshape Getting all dependencies} instructions (either installing dependencies yourself or adding to the {\ttfamily apt} path).

\+:warning\+: the versions of each software that you checkout are current as of the writing of this tutorial. If a newer {\itshape stable} version of Y\+CM or Y\+A\+RP is available it is recommended to upgrade to that version. Use {\ttfamily git ls-\/remote -\/-\/tags origin} to see all versions available.

Now you have dependencies, let\textquotesingle{}s install {\ttfamily Y\+CM}\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
cd ~/projects/YCM
git checkout v0.10.4
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=$INSTALL\_DIR
make install -j$(nproc)
\end{DoxyCode}


Then let\textquotesingle{}s install {\ttfamily Y\+A\+RP}\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
cd ~/projects/yarp
git checkout v3.2.1
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=$INSTALL\_DIR
make install -j$(nproc)
\end{DoxyCode}
 Finally, let\textquotesingle{}s install {\ttfamily event-\/driven}\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
cd ~/projects/event-driven
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=$INSTALL\_DIR
make install -j$(nproc)
\end{DoxyCode}


Continue with the tutorials to test your installation, or\+:

\subsubsection*{Install icub-\/main (optional)}

{\ttfamily icub-\/main} is used if you are using the i\+Cub robot and want to enable some of the {\ttfamily event-\/driven} modules that control the robot. To install {\ttfamily icub-\/main} do\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/robotology/icub-main.git
cd icub-main
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=$INSTALL\_DIR
make install -j$(nproc)
\end{DoxyCode}
